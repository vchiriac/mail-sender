/**
 * The emails can be sent as plain text or as HTML
 *  - emails which are sent outside the company servers need to be logged and have a disclaimer added to the end.
 *  What's worse, the emails could also be encrypted with AES or DES,
 * or even both at the same time.  Your boss tells you that in case there are problems when sending the emails you
 * should retry the sending operation up to three times.
 *
 * Design a simple client with the accompanying class(es) which you consider to be necessary and write a short program
 * inside the standard void main(String[] args) function that would implement the following scenarios by making use of
 * your class(es):

 路         sending a plain text email to an outside resource, with a disclaimer added at the end, unencrypted and no retry
 路         sending an HTML email to an internal server (so without the disclaimer), encrypted with DES, with the retry functionality
 路         sending an HTML email to an outside resource, with a disclaimer added at the end and encrypted with AES with retries in case of errors
 路         sending a plain text email to an outside resource and encrypted first with DES and then with AES
